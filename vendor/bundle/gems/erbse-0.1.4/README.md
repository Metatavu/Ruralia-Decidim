# Erbse

_An updated version of Erubis._

Erbse compiles an ERB string to a string of Ruby.

## API

The API is one public method.

```ruby
Erbse::Engine.new.call("<% ... %>") #=> string of compiled ruby.
```

The returned string can then be `eval`uated in a certain context.

## Output Buffers

Erbse does not use instance variables as output buffer, only local variables.

| Tag | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `<% %>` | Executes the code but does not output anything. |
| `<% .. do %>` | Executes the code but does not output anything. In the block, output is written to the current buffer. |
| `<%= %>` | Executes the code, outputs to current buffer. |
| `<%= .. do %>` | Executes the code and appends returned value to the current buffer. In the block, output is written to a new buffer that is returned when `yield`ing. |
| `<%@ .. do %>` | Executes the code but does not output anything. In the block, output is written to a new buffer that is returned when `yield`ing. |


## Block Yielding

Erbse supports blocks Ã  la Rails.

You may pass any mix of text/ERB via blocks to Ruby methods.

```erb
<%= form do %>
  <em>Please fill out all fields!</em>
  <%= input :email %>
  <button type="submit">
<% end %>
```

Here, the `form` method receives a block of compiled Ruby.

When `yield`ed, the block simply returns its evaluated content as a string. It's your job to assign it to an output buffer, **no instance variables are used**.

```ruby
def form(&block)
  content = yield
  "<form>#{content}</form>"
end
```
Usually, returning the content from the helper will be sufficient.

However, you can totally pass that block to a completely different object and yield it there. Since there's no global state as in ERB, this will work.

## Capture

With the `<%= helper do %>` tag, block content is assigned to a new output buffer and the result of `helper` rendered.

To capture the block without outputting anything, use the `<%@ %>` tag. This will still use a new output buffer for the block, but not output anything.

```erb
<%@ content = capture do %>
  Whatever
<% end %>

<%= content %>
```

The `capture` method will receive a block, what you do with it is up to you. It would usually simply yield the block.

```ruby
def capture(&block)
  yield
end
```

## Removed Features

Erbse does *not* support any tags other than `<% %>`, `<%= %>` and `<%@ %>`. Tags such as `<%% %>`, `<%== %>`, `<%- %>` or `<% -%>` will be reduced to the supported tags.

## TODO

The parser code got drastically reduced and might be missing essential features. [Please report](https://github.com/apotonick/erbse/issues) compiled syntax errors.

* Block comments
* Add newlines in compiled Ruby.

## Planned

Block inheritance.

```erb
<h1><%= title %></h1>

<% fragment :subheader do %>
  Or: <%= subheader %>
<% end %>
```

This fragment could then be overridden.

Feel free to contribute!!!
